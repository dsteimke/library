The Great Library of Alexandria has recently upgraded its broadband connection and would like to
serve its catalog of scholarly works to other libraries in the Ptolemaic Library System. Aristophanes,
the head librarian, has tasked you with creating a repository for managing this catalog built on the
tech stack already powering several internal GLoA services: Spring Boot, SQL, and Java.
The Department of Literary Anthropology has recently finished up a years long project to ensure
every work, whether it be a scroll, tablet, or codex, has a documented title, complete list of authors,
and a publication date. They've also attached Post-It Scrolls to some works that detail their volume
number if they're part of a series of works, a forward by a prominent scholar, and a list of citations
to other works (including page numbers and access time).
Some works are unique or exceedingly rare, and may not be taken off the GLoA campus. The rest of
the works are available to loan out to other libraries in the PLS, and shipping costs need to be
estimated based on the different publishing mediums.
Aristophanes holds you in high regard, and values your prior contributions to Abacus Theory. He has
allowed you free reign to design and implement this service how you see fit.
